157
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,234
Marge!

158
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,819
No, Homer.

159
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,779
Don't be jealous.
I was a schoolgirl.

160
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,906
The Beatles were very popular,
and I had a crush on them.

161
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,241
Likely story.

162
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,744
Oh, why did I have
to start my diet

163
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,329
on pork chop night?

164
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,082
Now Homer,
we've got steamed vegetables

165
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,959
and rice cakes for you.

166
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,878
(shudders)
Well, wait a minute.

167
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,547
Well, hey, I've been setting
my drinks on these things.

168
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,591
Well, they're only
35 calories apiece.

169
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,012
Hello? Hello?

170
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,181
Hello, taste?
Where are you?

171
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,017
You can put a little
something on top for flavor.

172
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,518
Hey, hey,
now you're talking.

173
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,562
Hey, Mom!
These paintings are good.

174
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,231
While I know firsthand
how fragile young talent is,

175
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,984
I'd love to hear the particulars
of how your gift was squashed.

176
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,360
(groans)
Well...

177
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,531
(scoffs)
No, not another portrait

178
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,241

Liverpudlian.

179
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,367
But Mr. Schindler, I--

180
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,786
Someone might have
used this canvas

181
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,497
to create a masterpiece.

182
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,166
Instead, you've
soiled it forever.

183
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,419
-Now, this is art.
-Thank you, Mr. Schindler.

Mmm, I never got any,
and I never painted again.

190
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,105
Maybe you could take a class
at Springfield Community College.

191

I think it's
a very nice idea.

197

Apu, what are you
doing here?

198
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,252
I've just enrolled in
the screenwriting class.

199
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,713
I yearn to tell the story
of an idealistic young Hindu

200
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,050
pushed too far
by convenience store bandits.

201
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,469
I call it
"Hands Off My Jerky, Turkey."

202
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,680
-Clever title.
-Oh, thank you.

203
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,306
Actually my brother
Sanjay thought of it.

204
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,267
-Next up.
-My mother would like to enroll

205
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,310
in "Painting From Life" 2-B,
please.

206
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,854
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not so fast there, pint-size.

207
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,482
I'm afraid no one can enroll
until Professor Lombardo

208
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,985
personally inspects and
approves their portfolio.

209
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,238
-Lisa, this was a bad idea.
-Mom!

210
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,284
Ah, very good.
Fabulous!

211
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,327
Ah, even better.

212
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,954
You have real talent.

213
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,664
Hmm. Do you
really think so?

214
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,583
My high school
art teacher hated them.

215
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,626
What? The man was a fool.

216
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,629
But still, one must admire
the force of his conviction.

217
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,673
-Then I'm in the class?
-Oh, my dear,

218
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,550
there couldn't be a class
without you.

219
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,053
Now, if you'll excuse me,
nature calls.

220
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,139
Marvelous!

221
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:02,226
(straining)
Stupid weights.

222
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,187
The heavy hands don't work
unless you move, Homer.

223
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,897
I can't move, boy.

224
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,190
Oh, really?

225
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,360
(grunting)
Oh!

226
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,113
Now, using the Lombardo method,

227
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,907
you learn to see
everyday objects

228
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,577
as a simple grouping
of geometrical shapes.

229
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,080
Here, we see how
two concentric circles

230
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,540
various trapezoids, ellipsis--

231
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,751
and yes, even a rhombus--

232
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,421
can create an adorable
little bunny rabbit.

This idea of yours to immortalize me

00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,816
These doughnuts are piling up.

313
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,276
Huh. Yeah, Homer Simpson
went on a diet.

314
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,696
Oh, my God,
and I just bought a boat.

315
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,911
(straining)

316
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,329
(tap)

317
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,499
Well, don't people answer
the door these days?

318
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,542
Allow me, sir.

319
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,670
Open up! Open up!

320
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,590
Mr. Burns. Oh, would
you like to come in?

321
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,343
Mr. Burns would like to commission you
to do a portrait of him.

322
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,262
Have you ever painted
the rich and powerful?

323
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,472
Well, no. Just Ringo Starr.

324
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,932
Ring-go?

325
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,642
He was the drummer
for a rock and roll combo

326
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,893
called The Beatles, sir.

327
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,021
Beatles, eh? Oh, yes.
I seem to remember

328
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,066
their off-key caterwauling
on the old Sullivan show.

329
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,276
What was Ed thinking?

330
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,194
Mrs. Simpson,
this commission

331
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,030
and all of its glory
can be yours

332
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,949
but first you must look me
straight in the eye

333
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,617
and answer one
simple question.

334
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,287
-Okay, shoot.
-Can you make me beautiful?

335
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,539
Hmm. Well, I don't think
that will be a problem.

336
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,583
I'm no matinee idol,
you know.

337
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,751
Well, maybe not,
but I have the gift

338
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,837
of being able
to see inner beauty.

339
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,424
Hmm. Mrs. Simpson,
you may immortalize me.

340
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,593
Ah, sir,

341
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,345
at last the world will
see you as I always have.

342
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,973
Yes, yes, yes. Now, don't be stingy
with the blush, Smithers.

343
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,016
There. There.

344
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,478
Now, you-- paint!

345
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,605
(groaning)

346
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,441
Honey, I'm home.

347
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,859
Oh, there's an
original sentiment.

348
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,902
(screams)

349
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,445
Take it outside, Simpson.

350
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,821
I'm male modeling.

351
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,448
I'm painting
his portrait, Homer.

352
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,117
(laughing)
Isn't that wonderful?

353
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,828
My work and my home life
come together

354
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,872
in such a nice way.

355
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,624
Marge, may I see you
in the other room?

356
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,375
Honey, he's nuts.
He thinks he's handsome.

357
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,835
Please, you've got
to make him look handsome.

358
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,503
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

359
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,047
Now, Homer, don't worry.

360
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,008
All I need to do is find
Mr. Burns' inner beauty.

361
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,552
Ohh! Okay.

362
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:33,098
Hmm. What were you like
as a boy, Mr. Burns?

363
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,683
Did you have a dog
that you loved?

364
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,393
Well...
(cries out)

365
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,938
There's something on my leg!
Get it off! Get it off!

366
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,732
-Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.
-BURNS: Ugh!

367
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,402
All right, all right.

368
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,696
Who took the funny pages?

369
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,865
So Ziggy goes
to the repair shop,

370
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,909
and there's a sign
on the doorbell reading

371
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,869
-"Out of order."
-(chuckles)

372
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,206
Ah, Ziggy, will you ever win?

373
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,376
(humming tune)

374
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,878
-Oh, my!
-If you'll excuse me,

375
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,964
I'm changing
for a board meeting.

376
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,424
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.

377
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,010
Hey, Mom, did he have
those spots all over his body?

378
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,595
-I heard that.
-Oops.

379
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,973
Would you feel more comfortable
if I left, too, sir?

380
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,393
Of course not, Smithers.
You're... you're like a doctor.

381
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,144
(kettle whistling)

382
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,480
BURNS: Smithers,
I want my tea!

383
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,732
Doesn't it bother you that
he orders you around like that?

384
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,152
(chuckles) Actually, I value
every second we're together

385
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,738
from the moment I squeeze
his orange juice in the morning

386
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,532
till I tuck him in at night.

387
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,034
He's not just my boss.
He's my best friend, too.

388
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,703
Bah! Too hot!

389
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,954
You're right, sir.

390
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,414
It's scalding me
as we speak.

391
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,873
(gasps, grumbles)

392
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,461
Dear Sally.

393
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,798
In response to your letter
of December 12, 1966,

394
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,800
me favorite color is blue,

395
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,427
and me real first name
is Richard.

396
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,595
-(bell dings)
-Thanks for the snapshot.

397
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,557
-You're a real cute bird. Love, Ringo.
-(bell dinging)

398
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,892
P.S. Forgive the lateness
of my reply.

399
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,729
-Mr. Starr, tea and crumpets.
-Just set it over there.

400
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,481
Sir, if you'll forgive an old
Brit his impertinence,

401
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,734
your devotion to your fans
is nothing short of remarkable.

402
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,445
Well, Weatherby, they took
the time to write me,

403
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,740
and I don't care
if it takes me another 20 years.

404
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,409
I'm going to answer
every one of them.

405
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,995
Hello. What's this?

406
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,415
From Springfield, U.S.A.

407
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,624
Gear.

408
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,546
♪♪

409
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,340
Will you cease
that infernal tootling?

410
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,301
-I was just practicing.
-(groans)

411
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,054
Mr. Burns, it's hard to
discover your inner beauty

412
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,139
while you're shouting
at an eight-year-old girl.

413
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,017
We've only got two days left,
so I'd advise you to shut up and paint!

414
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,060
(groans)

415
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,478
All right scale,

416
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,271
you don't like me
and I don't like you,

417
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,982
but I've been very good,
so you'd better treat me right.

418
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,568
All right! Whoa-ho-ho!

419
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,403
Whoo! Whoo!

420
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,491
Marge, I'm 239
and I'm feeling fine.

421
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,368
Look, I'm using the original
notches that came with my belt.

422
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,038
That's wonderful, Homer.
I'm so proud of--

423
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,664
Let me get this straight.

424
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,168
You're pleased
with your current appearance?

425
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,670
(laughs)
Why, my good man,

426
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,589
you're the fattest thing
I've ever seen

427
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,508
-and I've been on safari.
-(chuckling)

428
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,427
(crying) If you need me,
I'll be in the refrigerator.

429
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,138
-(sobbing)
-(groaning)

430
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,642
Mr. Burns, I've had enough
of your posing.

431
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,685
I can finish
the portrait myself.

432
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,480
Thank goodness. Another day
in this suburban nightmare,

433
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,981
and I would have needed
half a white Valium.

434
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,067
Thank you for your
gracious hospitality.

435
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,652
See you at the unveiling.

436
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,112
(whistling)

437
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,825
(gasps) Homer, what are you doing?
Give me that!

438
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,661
No, Burns is right.
What's the use?

439
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,539
Don't you listen to him.
He's just a mean, little S.O.B.

440
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,457
Oh, Marge.

441
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,334
I thought there was
some good in everybody

442
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,586
-until I met him.
-Yeah, well,

443
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,463
just as long as you paint
a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow.

444
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,965
-I don't think I can.
-What?

445
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,091
Marge, you have to!

446
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,676
I can't make that man
beautiful!

447
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,886
I'm just not good enough.

448
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,513
I guess I'm no artist.

449
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,141
Hmm. Hello. What's this?

450
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,352
It's for you, Marge,
from merry old England.

Friends, art lovers,
security personnel,

471
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,580
today is a red letter day

472
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,498
for the Springfield Palace
of Fine Arts.

473
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,002
A new wing for our museum,
ooh, and a portrait

474
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,421
commemorating the man
who ponied up the dough.

475
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,133
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I invite you

476
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,179
to behold Montgomery Burns.

477
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,890
(straining)

478
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,350
Smithers.

-(crowd gasps)
-(glass shatters)

480
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,898
-Oh.
-D'oh!

481
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,524
I don't care for this at all.

482
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,240
Um... hello.

483
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,702
My name is Marge Simpson,
and I painted this.

484
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,455
Maybe you'd like to know
what possessed me to do it.

485
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,125
Well, I guess I wanted to show

486
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,170
that beneath Mr. Burns'
fearsome head

487
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,756
with its cruel lips,
spiteful tongue

488
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,549
and evil brain,

489
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,261
there was a frail,
withered body,

490
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,805
perhaps not long
for this world,

491
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:09,935
as vulnerable and beautiful
as any of God's creatures.

492
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,687
-(applause)
-Hmm?

493
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,439
-MAN: Yes! Oh!
-(whistling)

494
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,858
Provocative but, uh, powerful.

495
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,944
He's bad, but he'll die.

496
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,195
So I like it.

497
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,571
Hmm...

498
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,865
Marge, a word, please.

499
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,743
You know, I'm no art critic

500
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:31,248
but I know what I hate,
and I don't hate this.

501
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,710
Your painting is bold
but beautiful

502
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,336
and, incidentally,

503
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,215
thanks for not making fun
of my genitalia.

504
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,883
I thought I did.
