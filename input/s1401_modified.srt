1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:03,256
Ha, ha, I don't know, neighbor-inos.
I'm all for Halloween fun

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:06,926
but a seance sounds a little PG-13.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,512
But this is your chance
to contact your late wife, Maude.

4
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:11,806
Well, I do miss the missus.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:18,229
Maude Flanders, we the living beseech you
to appear.

6
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:20,314
BART (as Maude): Ned...

7
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:22,316
I'm back.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,944
Give me a kiss.

9
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:25,987
(all screaming)

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,573
(in normal voice)
Chill out, dudes. It's me, Bart Simpson.

11
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:29,866
(whimpering)

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,784
What are you looking at?

13
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:34,454
(wailing)

14
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:35,538
(all screaming)

15
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:39,625
Maude. You still look as pretty
as the day I buried you.

16
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:40,918
(purrs)

17
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,588
Are you ready for tales

18
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:47,842
that will shatter your spine
and boil your blood?

19
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:52,472
-Well, duh.
-Then choke on these!

20
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:56,059
(laughing maniacally)

21
00:00:58,269 --> 00:00:59,979
(Homer screaming)

22
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,413
Now to spend some quality time
away from my family.

23
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,249
(sighs)

24
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,253
I've got a list of things
for you to do today.

25
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:27,215
-My favorite is number three.
-Oh, I'd love to.

26
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:29,717
But someone made me too many pancakes

27
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,886
and now I have to sleep them off.

28
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,764
Oh, those were for the Church breakfast.

29
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:36,265
Were they now?

30
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,017
(grunts)

31
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,185
(groans)

32
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:43,231
Hammocks. Get your hammocks.

33
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:46,943
The hammock man. I'm glad
he's a little early today.

34
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:50,780
The price is $10.

35
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:54,575
But I must warn you,
this is no ordinary hammock.

36
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,746
Its webbing is a mesh of comfort and evil.

37
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,081
You had me at "comfort."

38
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:06,963
Mm-hmm. Hmm, Mr. Hammock,
say hello to Madam Ass.

39
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:08,714
(grunting)

40
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,174
(shouting)

41
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,805
What the... It made another me.

42
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:17,682
How cool is that?

43
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,017
(groans)

44
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:23,312
Hmm, no bellybutton.

45
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:24,730
Shuttle's in the hangar.

46
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:26,607
You wanna be my slave?

47
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:28,442
(moaning indistinctly)

48
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:29,986
Outstanding.

49
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,072
-Oh, uh... Mm-hmm.
-(electricity crackling)

50
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:34,448
Speed it up, ugly.

51
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:36,075
-(Homer clone screams)
-(thuds)

52
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:39,829
(Homer grunts)

53
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,956
Eh, he had a good run.

54
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,126
(grunting)

55
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,588
I'm gonna need help with this. Hmm.

56
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,884
(grunting)

57
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,303
(laughs)

58
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:56,345
(slurps)

59
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:58,514
Beer for me?

60
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:00,641
No, you've got chores to do.

61
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:03,144
Chores? Me need clone.

62
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:06,189
Clone? That's ridiculous.

63
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:07,899
Where am I supposed to find a...

64
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:09,650
Wait a minute.

65
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:13,279
(grunting)

66
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:15,907
Wow, four of me.

67
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,993
I think this could be a magic hammock.

68
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,539
And it just might be the answer
to my problems.

69
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:25,791
-Uh...
-MARGE: What do you think, Homer?

70
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,585
Does this make my hips look big?

71
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:29,879
(in monotone voice)
Outfit good, flatters butt.

72
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:31,964
Oh, aren't you a dear?

73
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:35,426
Then after World War II,
it got kind of quiet

74
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:39,847
till Superman challenged FDR
to a race around the world.

75
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:42,558
FDR beat him by a furlong.

76
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:45,353
Or so the comic books
would have you believe.

77
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:48,064
The truth lies somewhere in between...

78
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:50,524
(snoring)

79
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:55,613
(Homer grunts)

80
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,073
(grunts)

81
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:58,950
Me good dad.

82
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:03,996
Hmm. Does Dad seem
a little dumber than usual?

83
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:08,167
Me not notice.

84
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:11,963
Homie, you've been
such a sweetheart today.

85
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:13,047
Let's go upstairs and...

86
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,091
(whispers)

87
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:16,384
(chuckles)

88
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:18,386
(grunts)

89
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,597
-I'll take it from here, fake-o.
-Uh-uh.

90
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:23,140
-Uh-huh. Unh!
-Unh!

91
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:26,227
(in unison) Why you little... Aah!

92
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,020
Man, are we evenly matched.

93
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:29,188
Me concur.

94
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:31,607
(both gagging)

95
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:34,443
-(yells)
-(laughs)

96
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:37,947
It would take three clones
to beat the original Homer.

97
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,407
ALL: Hmm.

98
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:41,117
Huh, I mean four.

99
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,744
-ALL: Oh.
-Suckers.

100
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,582
(chattering)

101
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,712
MARGE: Kids, your father
made us breakfast.

102
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,297
BART AND LISA: Yay!

103
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,632
-Go, go, go.
-OK.

104
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,635
(kids munching)

105
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,930
Say, Homer, I was, uh...

106
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:06,475
I was wondering if I could borrow
that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me.

107
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,561
Yeah, but you have to leave a credit card.

108
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:11,230
-No problem. Discover OK?
-Ned.

109
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,357
OK, here's my Amex.

110
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:17,445
(grunts)

111
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:18,946
Mm-hm.

112
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:24,744
Homie, I must say you have the energy
of 20 men lately.

113
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,037
Twenty-three.

114
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,457
Now, today, I'm gonna mow the lawn,
do my taxes, shoot hoops with Bart

115
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,625
and girl it up with Lisa.

116
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:32,918
Aw.

117
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,715
-(yelps)
-(door slams)

118
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:40,092
(groaning)

119
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:42,678
Oh, I gotta get rid of these guys.

120
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:44,597
(tires squeal)

121
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:48,225
Now, before I abandon you
in this cornfield,

122
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:50,436
does anyone remember the way home?

123
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,645
I do.

124
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,105
-(fires)
-(body thuds)

125
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,315
Anybody else?

126
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:57,526
Anybody else?

127
00:05:58,194 --> 00:05:59,070
Come on.

128
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:02,740
OK, everyone out.

129
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:05,451
(all grunting)

130
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:10,706
Now to make sure this hammock
never troubles anyone again.

131
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,707
(grunts)

132
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,958
(tires screeching)

133
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,669
Ooh. Mm?

134
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,172
(groans)

135
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,095
(chattering)

136
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,143
Let's all go out for some frosty
chocolate milk shakes.

137
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:35,773
(all moaning)

138
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,948
Ah, look at that corn. Old Gil's hard work
is finally paying off.

139
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,117
(munching)

140
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:50,413
Well, at least I got my health.

141
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:54,291
Aw.

142
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:57,002
CLONES: Beer, beer, beer.
Beer, beer, beer.

143
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,006
-(cans ripping open)
-(clones gulping)

144
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,468
(clones babbling)

145
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:05,886
(pants unzipping)

146
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:08,180
(clones sighing)

147
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,474
<i>Like comedy clubs in the late '80s,</i>

148
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:13,102
<i>these ravenous clones are everywhere.</i>

149
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:15,813
<i>They've destroyed every building in town</i>

150
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,941
<i>except Moe's Tavern, which is reporting</i>
<i>record business.</i>

151
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,401
(chattering)

152
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:21,610
(gulping)

153
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:24,029
Now, uh, who's gonna be
picking up the tab?

154
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:25,948
ALL: Lenny.

155
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,992
Anything for Homers.

156
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:31,162
Dad, is there something
you'd like to tell us about this horde?

157
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:32,830
You'd think so, but no.

158
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:36,417
They look like you, they were rude
to Patty and Selma,

159
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,337
and the horde has been
describes very gassy.

160
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,755
Yeah, it's a good group.

161
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,091
Currently the, uh, Vietcong--

162
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:47,344
I mean, the, uh, Homers
are occupying these areas.

163
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:49,096
By tomorrow...

164
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:53,100
(all shuddering)

165
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:55,352
Good God, we're doomed.

166
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:57,104
No!

167
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,024

329
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,158
Hey, I'm on vacation.

330
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:34,830
Dr. Hibbert, this is a topnotch resort.

331
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:36,790
Can you recommend some activities?

332
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:40,419
Well, one activity you might enjoy
is not asking questions.

333
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:42,421
(laughs)

334
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:45,882
But man's inquisitive nature
is what separates us from the animals.

335
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,801
And why must we be separated, dammit?

336
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,636
Think what Shakespeare
might've accomplished

337
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,179
if he'd had the eyes of an eagle

338
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:53,056
or could spray stink on his critics.

339
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,768
Now, who'd like some turkey?
It's a lovely nerd...

340
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:58,937
(laughs) I mean "bird."

341
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:00,981
(screams)

342
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,400
No! Wait a minute now.

343
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:06,611
Guess what, I'm dying, ha, ha...

344
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,864
...with the basting and the butterballing

345
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:11,950
and the chestnut stuffing in my pupik.

346
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,536
Gobble, gobble, gobble. Death.

347
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,083
Homie, something very creepy
is going on here.

348
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,461
You mean they're gonna try
to sell us timeshares?

349
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:24,421
I think I'm going to do
a little sleuthing.

350
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:25,547
Bring back some ice.

351
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,717
(people shouting nearby)

352
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,263
"House of pain." This must be where
you pay the bill.

353
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:35,140
(laughs)

354
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:38,393
Why am I always so funny
when no one's around?

355
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:39,936
(groaning)

356
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,064
Oh, I'm around.

357
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:44,983
(Marge shouting and growling)

358
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,404
(purrs)

359
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:53,617
Unh. What's up, honey?
Want a little loving?

360
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,119
(purrs)

361
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:57,621
Woo-hoo, quite a tiger there.

362
00:17:57,704 --> 00:18:00,791
Easy, easy. Ha, ha,
I guess it has been a while.

363
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:02,876
OK, that hurts more than it tickles.

364
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,628
(Marge purring)

365
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,088
Quiet, youse.

366
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:08,173
-(thuds)
-(Marge yelps)

367
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:10,926
Isn't vacation sex always the best?

368
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:13,011
(growls in agreement)

369
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:15,430
Marge, you were like a wild beast.

370
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:17,224
So voracious and prowly.

371
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:21,019
And I've never seen you
use your tail like that.

372
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,187
(bird chirps)

373
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,605
(growls)

374
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:28,110
What the... Oh, my God.
She's become a monster.

375
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:31,780
Which I have to admit, I sort of suspected
during the sex.

376
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:34,491
(groans)

377
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:36,743
Gotta find a way to change Marge back.

378
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:39,037
And replace the M&M'S I took
from the minibar.

379
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,872
NED: Hey, Homer.

380
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:42,165
Flanders.

381
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:44,876
Oh, a perfect vacation ruined.

382
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,088
Hate to be a needy Neddy,
but could you do me a favor?

383
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:51,299
-Hmm.
-Milk me.

384
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:54,386
Uh, I really don't wanna do that, Ned.

385
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:57,472
Oh, come on, Homer. All I'm asking
is for you to yank my teats

386
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:59,808
-and harvest my milk.
-Ugh, fine.

387
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:04,354
Ooh, that's nice.

388
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:06,148
You're actually quite
gentle when you wanna be.

389
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,732
You know, you're not helping.

390

(indistinct chattering)

394
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,160
Huh! What's that?

395
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,124
(grunts)

396
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,334
(squeaks)

397
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,795
I'm a dog.

00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:31,715
(blows horn)

399
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:33,967
Hear me, accursed brethren.

400
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,889
I understand that some of you
are still wearing tattered pants.

401
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:41,183
Please, throw them on the bonfire

402
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:43,476
and embrace your animal essence.

403
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:48,398
OK, but I'm keeping the tattered vest.
I still have my dignity.

404
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,691
Hey, slops.

405
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,236
Ooh, a toenail. Ha, ha.

406
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:55,572
I can't believe it.

407
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:58,241
Hibbert's turned you all
into human guinea pigs.

408
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:00,702
We prefer "Italian-American pigs."

409
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,078
Hey, Dad, check it out.

410
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:08,043
"Eat my shorts"? Why, you little...

411
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,754
Maggie.

412
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:15,050
Lisa. Ugh!

413
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,551
We were just playing.

414
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:17,802
What game?

415
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:19,179
Let's Eat Maggie.

417
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:23,558
Manimals, inverta-broads.

418
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:26,311
You must fight back against
the one who did this to you.

419
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:29,856
Yar, the half-man, half-gorilla
speaks the truth.

(laughing)

422
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:37,656
Now, I admit I made a few mistakes,

423
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,366
but all in the name of progress.

424
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:40,742
Hear, hear.

425

-It's Mr. Burns.
-With a fox attitude.

426
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:46,081
Think about it, my hideous children.

427
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,917
Aren't you better off now
than you were as humans?

All you can do is eat and sleep

434
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:06,518
and mate, and roll around
in your own filth

435
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:09,396
and mate and eat-- Where do I sign up?

So how do you like being a walrus, Dad?

438
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:19,114
It's great. I haven't been
this skinny since high school.
