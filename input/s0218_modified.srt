157
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,234
Marge!

158
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:19,819
No, Homer.

159
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,779
Don't be jealous.
I was a schoolgirl.

160
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:23,906
The Beatles were very popular,
and I had a crush on them.

161
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,241
Likely story.

162
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:28,744
Oh, why did I have
to start my diet

163
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:30,329
on pork chop night?

164
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:33,082
Now Homer,
we've got steamed vegetables

165
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,959
and rice cakes for you.

166
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,878
(shudders)
Well, wait a minute.

167
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:39,547
Well, hey, I've been setting
my drinks on these things.

168
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,591
Well, they're only
35 calories apiece.

169
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:46,012
Hello? Hello?

170
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:48,181
Hello, taste?
Where are you?

171
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:51,017
You can put a little
something on top for flavor.

172
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,518
Hey, hey,
now you're talking.

173
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,562
Hey, Mom!
These paintings are good.

174
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:57,231
While I know firsthand
how fragile young talent is,

175
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:59,984
I'd love to hear the particulars
of how your gift was squashed.

176
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,360
(groans)
Well...

177
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,531
(scoffs)
No, not another portrait

178
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:07,241

Liverpudlian.

179
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:08,367
But Mr. Schindler, I--

180
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,786
Someone might have
used this canvas

181
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,497
to create a masterpiece.

182
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,166
Instead, you've
soiled it forever.

183
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:18,419
-Now, this is art.
-Thank you, Mr. Schindler.

Mmm, I never got any,
and I never painted again.

190
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,105
Maybe you could take a class
at Springfield Community College.

191

I think it's
a very nice idea.

197

Apu, what are you
doing here?

198
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,252
I've just enrolled in
the screenwriting class.

199
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:02,713
I yearn to tell the story
of an idealistic young Hindu

200
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:06,050
pushed too far
by convenience store bandits.

201
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,469
I call it
"Hands Off My Jerky, Turkey."

202
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:10,680
-Clever title.
-Oh, thank you.

203
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:12,306
Actually my brother
Sanjay thought of it.

204
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,267
-Next up.
-My mother would like to enroll

205
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,310
in "Painting From Life" 2-B,
please.

206
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:18,854
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not so fast there, pint-size.

207
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,482
I'm afraid no one can enroll
until Professor Lombardo

208
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,985
personally inspects and
approves their portfolio.

209
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:27,238
-Lisa, this was a bad idea.
-Mom!

210
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:31,284
Ah, very good.
Fabulous!

211
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,327
Ah, even better.

212
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:34,954
You have real talent.

213
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:36,664
Hmm. Do you
really think so?

214
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,583
My high school
art teacher hated them.

215
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,626
What? The man was a fool.

216
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,629
But still, one must admire
the force of his conviction.

217
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,673
-Then I'm in the class?
-Oh, my dear,

218
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:47,550
there couldn't be a class
without you.

219
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:51,053
Now, if you'll excuse me,
nature calls.

220
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:53,139
Marvelous!

221
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:57,226
(straining)
Stupid weights.

222
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,187
The heavy hands don't work
unless you move, Homer.

223
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,897
I can't move, boy.

224
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,190
Oh, really?

225
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:06,360
(grunting)
Oh!

226
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:09,113
Now, using the Lombardo method,

227
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:11,907
you learn to see
everyday objects

228
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,577
as a simple grouping
of geometrical shapes.

229
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,080
Here, we see how
two concentric circles

230
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:19,540
various trapezoids, ellipsis--

231
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,751
and yes, even a rhombus--

232
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:25,421
can create an adorable
little bunny rabbit.

This idea of yours to immortalize me

00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,816
These doughnuts are piling up.

313
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,276
Huh. Yeah, Homer Simpson
went on a diet.

314
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,696
Oh, my God,
and I just bought a boat.

315
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:43,911
(straining)

316
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:45,329
(tap)

317
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:48,499
Well, don't people answer
the door these days?

318
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:49,542
Allow me, sir.

319
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,670
Open up! Open up!

320
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:56,590
Mr. Burns. Oh, would
you like to come in?

321
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:59,343
Mr. Burns would like to commission you
to do a portrait of him.

322
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:01,262
Have you ever painted
the rich and powerful?

323
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:03,472
Well, no. Just Ringo Starr.

324
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:04,932
Ring-go?

325
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,642
He was the drummer
for a rock and roll combo

326
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:07,893
called The Beatles, sir.

327
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,021
Beatles, eh? Oh, yes.
I seem to remember

328
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:14,066
their off-key caterwauling
on the old Sullivan show.

329
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:15,276
What was Ed thinking?

330
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,194
Mrs. Simpson,
this commission

331
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,030
and all of its glory
can be yours

332
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:21,949
but first you must look me
straight in the eye

333
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:23,617
and answer one
simple question.

334
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:26,287
-Okay, shoot.
-Can you make me beautiful?

335
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,539
Hmm. Well, I don't think
that will be a problem.

336
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,583
I'm no matinee idol,
you know.

337
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,751
Well, maybe not,
but I have the gift

338
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,837
of being able
to see inner beauty.

339
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,424
Hmm. Mrs. Simpson,
you may immortalize me.

340
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:40,593
Ah, sir,

341
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:43,345
at last the world will
see you as I always have.

342
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,973
Yes, yes, yes. Now, don't be stingy
with the blush, Smithers.

343
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:47,016
There. There.

344
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,478
Now, you-- paint!

345
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:52,605
(groaning)

346
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:55,441
Honey, I'm home.

347
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:56,859
Oh, there's an
original sentiment.

348
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:57,902
(screams)

349
00:14:57,985 --> 00:14:59,445
Take it outside, Simpson.

350
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:00,821
I'm male modeling.

351
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,448
I'm painting
his portrait, Homer.

352
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:05,117
(laughing)
Isn't that wonderful?

353
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,828
My work and my home life
come together

354
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,872
in such a nice way.

355
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,624
Marge, may I see you
in the other room?

356
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:13,375
Honey, he's nuts.
He thinks he's handsome.

357
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:14,835
Please, you've got
to make him look handsome.

358
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,503
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

359
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:18,047
Now, Homer, don't worry.

360
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,008
All I need to do is find
Mr. Burns' inner beauty.

361
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:23,552
Ohh! Okay.

362
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:28,098
Hmm. What were you like
as a boy, Mr. Burns?

363
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,683
Did you have a dog
that you loved?

364
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,393
Well...
(cries out)

365
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,938
There's something on my leg!
Get it off! Get it off!

366
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:36,732
-Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.
-BURNS: Ugh!

367
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,402
All right, all right.

368
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,696
Who took the funny pages?

369
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,865
So Ziggy goes
to the repair shop,

370
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:46,909
and there's a sign
on the doorbell reading

371
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:48,869
-"Out of order."
-(chuckles)

372
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:52,206
Ah, Ziggy, will you ever win?

373
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,376
(humming tune)

374
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,878
-Oh, my!
-If you'll excuse me,

375
00:15:57,962 --> 00:15:59,964
I'm changing
for a board meeting.

376
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,424
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.

377
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:05,010
Hey, Mom, did he have
those spots all over his body?

378
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,595
-I heard that.
-Oops.

379
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,973
Would you feel more comfortable
if I left, too, sir?

380
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:12,393
Of course not, Smithers.
You're... you're like a doctor.

381
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,144
(kettle whistling)

382
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:16,480
BURNS: Smithers,
I want my tea!

383
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:18,732
Doesn't it bother you that
he orders you around like that?

384
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:22,152
(chuckles) Actually, I value
every second we're together

385
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:24,738
from the moment I squeeze
his orange juice in the morning

386
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,532
till I tuck him in at night.

387
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:29,034
He's not just my boss.
He's my best friend, too.

388
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:30,703
Bah! Too hot!

389
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:31,954
You're right, sir.

390
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:33,414
It's scalding me
as we speak.

391
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:34,873
(gasps, grumbles)

392
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,461
Dear Sally.

393
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:42,798
In response to your letter
of December 12, 1966,

394
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,800
me favorite color is blue,

395
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:46,427
and me real first name
is Richard.

396
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,595
-(bell dings)
-Thanks for the snapshot.

397
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,557
-You're a real cute bird. Love, Ringo.
-(bell dinging)

398
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,892
P.S. Forgive the lateness
of my reply.

399
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:56,729
-Mr. Starr, tea and crumpets.
-Just set it over there.

400
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:59,481
Sir, if you'll forgive an old
Brit his impertinence,

401
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,734
your devotion to your fans
is nothing short of remarkable.

402
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:04,445
Well, Weatherby, they took
the time to write me,

403
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:07,740
and I don't care
if it takes me another 20 years.

404
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,409
I'm going to answer
every one of them.

405
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:12,995
Hello. What's this?

406
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:16,415
From Springfield, U.S.A.

407
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:17,624
Gear.

408
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,546
♪♪

409
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:25,340
Will you cease
that infernal tootling?

410
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:27,301
-I was just practicing.
-(groans)

411
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:30,054
Mr. Burns, it's hard to
discover your inner beauty

412
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:32,139
while you're shouting
at an eight-year-old girl.

413
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:35,017
We've only got two days left,
so I'd advise you to shut up and paint!

414
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,060
(groans)

415
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:37,478
All right scale,

416
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:39,271
you don't like me
and I don't like you,

417
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:41,982
but I've been very good,
so you'd better treat me right.

418
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,568
All right! Whoa-ho-ho!

419
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:46,403
Whoo! Whoo!

420
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:50,491
Marge, I'm 239
and I'm feeling fine.

421
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:53,368
Look, I'm using the original
notches that came with my belt.

422
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:56,038
That's wonderful, Homer.
I'm so proud of--

423
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,664
Let me get this straight.

424
00:17:57,748 --> 00:18:01,168
You're pleased
with your current appearance?

425
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:03,670
(laughs)
Why, my good man,

426
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:05,589
you're the fattest thing
I've ever seen

427
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:07,508
-and I've been on safari.
-(chuckling)

428
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:10,427
(crying) If you need me,
I'll be in the refrigerator.

429
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:13,138
-(sobbing)
-(groaning)

430
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:16,642
Mr. Burns, I've had enough
of your posing.

431
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,685
I can finish
the portrait myself.

432
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:21,480
Thank goodness. Another day
in this suburban nightmare,

433
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:22,981
and I would have needed
half a white Valium.

434
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:25,067
Thank you for your
gracious hospitality.

435
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,652
See you at the unveiling.

436
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:28,112
(whistling)

437
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:32,825
(gasps) Homer, what are you doing?
Give me that!

438
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:35,661
No, Burns is right.
What's the use?

439
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:38,539
Don't you listen to him.
He's just a mean, little S.O.B.

440
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:40,457
Oh, Marge.

441
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,334
I thought there was
some good in everybody

442
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,586
-until I met him.
-Yeah, well,

443
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,463
just as long as you paint
a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow.

444
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:47,965
-I don't think I can.
-What?

445
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:49,091
Marge, you have to!

446
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,676
I can't make that man
beautiful!

447
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,886
I'm just not good enough.

448
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,513
I guess I'm no artist.

449
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:57,141
Hmm. Hello. What's this?

450
00:18:57,224 --> 00:19:00,352
It's for you, Marge,
from merry old England.

Friends, art lovers,
security personnel,

471
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:01,580
today is a red letter day

472
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,498
for the Springfield Palace
of Fine Arts.

473
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:07,002
A new wing for our museum,
ooh, and a portrait

474
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:09,421
commemorating the man
who ponied up the dough.

475
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:13,133
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I invite you

476
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:17,179
to behold Montgomery Burns.

477
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:19,890
(straining)

478
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:21,350
Smithers.

-(crowd gasps)
-(glass shatters)

480
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:27,898
-Oh.
-D'oh!

481
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:29,524
I don't care for this at all.

482
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:36,240
Um... hello.

483
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:40,702
My name is Marge Simpson,
and I painted this.

484
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:43,455
Maybe you'd like to know
what possessed me to do it.

485
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:47,125
Well, I guess I wanted to show

486
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:50,170
that beneath Mr. Burns'
fearsome head

487
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:52,756
with its cruel lips,
spiteful tongue

488
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,549
and evil brain,

489
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,261
there was a frail,
withered body,

490
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,805
perhaps not long
for this world,

491
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:04,935
as vulnerable and beautiful
as any of God's creatures.

492
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:06,687
-(applause)
-Hmm?

493
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,439
-MAN: Yes! Oh!
-(whistling)

494
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,858
Provocative but, uh, powerful.

495
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:13,944
He's bad, but he'll die.

496
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:15,195
So I like it.

497
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,571
Hmm...

498
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,865
Marge, a word, please.

499
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:21,743
You know, I'm no art critic

500
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:26,248
but I know what I hate,
and I don't hate this.

501
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:29,710
Your painting is bold
but beautiful

502
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:31,336
and, incidentally,

503
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,215
thanks for not making fun
of my genitalia.

504
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:36,883
I thought I did.
