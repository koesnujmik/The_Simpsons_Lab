00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,225
enjoying our famous
low humidity?

36
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:37,184
I'll say.

37
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:38,936
The only thing lower
than our humidity

38
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,314
are the greens fees
on our public golf course.

Which one?

All three!

00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:46,027
Yes. Yes.

What are you doing
here in Shelbyville?

45
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,790
I came here for
the legalized gambling.

46
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:01,000
But Springfield Billy,

47
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,085
we don't have
legalized gambling here.

48
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:04,337
Sure you do.

49
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,382
I saw a bumper sticker
that said "Free Tibet."

50

(laughter)

51
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:15,598

Springfielders are stupid hicks.

52
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,933

in a mirror.

53
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,769
What's a mirror?

54
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:22,688
It's a big city word

For your information,

intelligent and articulate.

I've never heard such
mean-spirited hate-hoots.

67
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:58,641
We've got to upgrade
Springfield's image,

68
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,685
show them we're more
than just a town

69
00:03:00,768 --> 00:03:02,144
that's still afraid
of eclipses.

70
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,399
Hey, how 'bout we open
a fancy restaurant,

71
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:09,110
and when people check their hats
and coats, we steal 'em?

72
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:10,986
Why do you come
to these meetings?

73
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,154
Free water.

74
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:13,406
There must
be something else.

Scary rhymes with Gehry!

83
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,626
That's it!

84
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,129
Architect Frank Gehry!

85
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,839
He could build us
a concert hall

86
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:31,674
like he did in Los Angeles.

87
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:33,843
Well, we could
use a new HQ

88
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:35,428
for the Springfield
Philharmonic.

89
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:37,847
They're playing Gustav Mahler
in abject squalor.

Next time we're keeping it.

93
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:46,856
Then it's agreed.

94
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:50,192
We ask Frank Gehry
to build us a concert hall.

95
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:54,780
Bill, bill,

96

if not for a letter I received
from one little girl.

111
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,154
I wrote that letter.

112
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:38,240
You wrote I was "the bestest
architect in the world"?

113
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:39,116
Well, aren't you?

114
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,951
All in favor of building

115
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:43,954

Yo, Frank Gehry!

120
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:06,811

I'm so excited.

137
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:42,513
It's like giving birth

The symphony,
she has just started!

141
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:58,904
So? We already heard
the "dum dum dum dum."

142
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:00,155
The rest
is just filler.

143
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,532
I thought
this was gonna be

144
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:03,576
the soundtrack
to the movie <i>Beethoven.</i>

145
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,119
Was I sadly mistaken.

146
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,954
It sounds better

We didn't have time.

We're broke,
but I have a plan.

158

We change the name of the town
to escape our creditors.

a new drape hole.

you go nuts

00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,773
It's-it's
my <i>raison d'etre.</i>

330
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:38,238
(sniffs) Ew.

331
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:41,491
Smokey, you've got
that awful smell on you again.

332
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:42,326
Hey!

333
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:44,161
That's the smell
of her real family!

334
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:45,579
The Simpsons!

335
00:13:45,662 --> 00:13:46,788
And for your information,

336
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,207
our walls have a bunch
of dead raccoons in them,

337
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,877
but we are saving up
the money to find them.

338
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,629
Well, whatever.
Smokey's our cat.

339
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:55,630
(meows)

340
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:57,716
Smokey, stay!

341
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,843
Now back.

342
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,053
Heel.

343
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:02,471
Snowball does tricks?

344
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:05,891
Sure. C'mon, Smokey,
do your Smokey shuffle.

345
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:08,977
(kids clapping)

346
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,815
Well, I don't care
what you say.

347
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,609
She still loves us more.

348
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,444
Don't you, Snowball?

349
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:19,446
(hisses, snarls)

350
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:22,491
(purring)

351
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:24,368
You toyed with my heart

352
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:26,828
like it was a toy heart.

353
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:28,997
(wheels squeaking)

354
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,916
Gentlemen, we must determine

355
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:32,584
which of our fellow
inmates has become

356
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,587
the Rodentus
Incarcerarium.

357
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,798
You heard the boss.
Find the rat.

358
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:40,342
I found the rat,
and he's right here.

359
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,052
I ain't the rat;
I'm the pigeon.

360
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:43,345
I thought you
was the mole.

361
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:45,555
No, you're thinking of that
guy who was the canary.

362
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,807
But we can all agree,

363
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,559
we work in a business
with a very rich lexicon.

364
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:50,852
Rich lexicon,
very rich.

365
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:52,521
(murmuring in agreement)

366
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:55,023
Ooh, a Tiffany's box!

367
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:57,442
And the thing inside
is <i>from </i>Tiffany's!

368
00:14:57,526 --> 00:14:59,069
Homie, you've never
done this before.

369
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:00,654
How'd you afford it?

370
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:03,490
Well, if you
really must know, uh,

371
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:05,951
I'm a prison snitch.

372
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:06,827
(gasps)

373
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,662
Haven't you seen
what happens to people

374
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:10,664
who rat in prison movies?

375
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:12,165
Sure, they're on top
of the world.

376
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:14,334
Then there's
a big riot scene.

377
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,670
Then... I don't know.
I usually doze off.

378
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,964
The prison snitch is killed!

379
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:20,048
And that could be you.

380
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,342
Because you're
the prison snitch!

381
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:23,510
(all gasp)

382
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:24,344
(growling)

383
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:25,429
What are you
dopes looking at?

384
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:28,140
You've never seen
bling-bling before?

385
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:30,392
What is it they have
that keeps Snowball

386
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:32,269
coming back
to their house?

387
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:33,979
Only one way
to find out.

388
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:39,901
My baby turtle crawled
into your basement window.

389
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:42,028
Oh, you poor boy.

390
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:43,613
What's
your turtle's name?

391
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:45,031
Uh...

392
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:46,575
Apron Boobs-face?

393
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:47,451
Really?

394
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,369
Well, let's go find it.

395
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:50,954
And what's your name?

396
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,080
Uh...

397
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:55,208
Shoes... Butt-back?

398
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,710
HOMER: Uh-huh.

399
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:58,336
Hmm.

400
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:02,883
Psst.

401
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,176
There's a jailbreak
tonight.

402
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,927
How come nobody
told me before?

403
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:08,638
I sent you an e-vite.
You never responded.

404
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:11,516
Nice netiquette, jerk.

405
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:15,437
There's gonna be
a breakout tonight.

406
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,521
Very good.

407
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:18,815
Now, I'd like a little
more information.

408
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,444
Are biographies arranged
by author or subject?

409
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:27,824
What is Bart still
doing in there?

410
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:30,410
You forgot to take
some brownies.

411
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:32,787
Thanks, Mother Dexter!
I'll be back tomorrow.

412
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,831
Bart, why were you
in there so long?

413
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:36,458
Lis, that place is great!

414
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,834
They have a jukebox
in the basement.

415
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,836
And look at the trick
they taught me!

416
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,589
(humming a circus tune)

417
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:44,883
Are you watching?
Are you watching?

418
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:45,967
(groans)

419
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:50,639
When they come busting out,
we'll be ready.

420
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:53,475
Every single guard
is outside waiting for them.

421
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:55,477
Something don't
feel right.

422
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,687
Usually when
there's a jailbreak,

423
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:00,106
there's electricity
in the air,

424
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,026
like the calm
before a summer storm.

425
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,195
Or, uh, right before
a heavyweight fight.

426
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:06,905
Mine's more poetic.

427
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:07,864
(grunts)

428
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:10,534
Now, where the hell are they?

429
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:12,869
<i>PRISONERS (chanting):</i>
<i>Kill the rat!</i>

430
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:19,251
Kill the rat!
Kill the rat!

431
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:20,627
What happened
to the guards?!

432
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,003
PRISONERS: Kill the rat!

433
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:23,797
Okay, okay. Don't panic.

434
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,132
Maybe they'll tire themselves
out with their chant.

435
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,634
Kill the rat!

436
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,054
(screams)

437
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,182
I call the balls

438
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,767
(all clamoring)

439
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:41,606
Marge, they're gonna kill me!

440
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,024
Oh, eh...

441
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:45,735
I only did what I had
to do to survive...

442
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,738
in a style befitting
a French monarch.

444
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,159

(screaming fades)

448
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,460
We've all heard
of a laugh riot,

449
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:03,920
but a prison riot?

450
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:05,171
Kent Brockman high above

00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:07,048
Montgomery Burns
State Penitentiary,

452
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:10,927
where our expensive
Thermocam 3000 is finally

453
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:11,970
being used for something.

454
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:14,556
<i>This red glow is the heat</i>

(grunts)
Marge!

00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:31,781
How did you get in here?

464
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:33,408
As president
of the cultural board,

465
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,577
I was given a key
to the concert hall.

466
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:40,498
There's the filthy rat
we're gonna kill.

467
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:44,169
And his wife, who sometimes
drives my son home from school.

468
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:46,463
Oh, you must be
Michael's dad!

469
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:47,964
Marge, c'mon!

470
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:49,716
We'll be safe
in the gas chamber.

00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,759
Go!

472
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,601
I want you to look into
the faces of those poor men.

473
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:03,313
Each one is a life you made
worse with your ratting.

Oh, Marge,

476
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:12,572
I'm sorry I got you
into this mess.

477
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:15,950
Can I snitch on my heart
and say I love you?

478
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:18,244
Oh, Homie...

479

You can come in, governor.

484
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,395
Well, I'll make these rioters
regret their folly.

485
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:46,064
This prison will make Abu Ghraib
look like the Four Seasons.

486
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:48,358
Smithers, we'll
need electrical wire, a hood

487
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:51,152
and someone who can really
point at genitalia.

488

00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:57,200
Hold on a minute.

491
00:19:57,283 --> 00:20:00,245
Governor, I've been using
my powers of snitching for evil,

492
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:02,789
but now I want
to tattle for good.

493
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:04,499
This prison
is a hellhole.

494
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,084
They feed us
horse meat,

495
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,919
with traces
of jockey meat!

496
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:10,922
I'll have you know I buy
the finest cuts of beef.

497
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:16,720
(bugle playing)

498
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:18,430
The guards
are sadistic and cruel.

499
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:20,515
I can't help
the way I am.

500
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:21,349
When I was a boy,

501
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,269
I saw my father murdered
before my eyes.

502
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:25,353
By me.

503
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:28,106
Governor, I think
the only fair solution

504
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,817
is to pardon all
these thugs and murderers.

505
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,945
Well, since there's no room
in the prisons you came from,

506
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:36,030
I'm releasing you all
to a garbage barge,

507
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:37,615
where you will
bare-knuckle-box

508
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:40,410
till one of you emerges
as king of your floating hell.

509
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:42,078
(cheering)

510
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:45,039
You know what I missed
in the joint?

511
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:48,418
Just lying here watching you
sleeping sweetly.

512
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:51,087
Sleeping sweetly.

513
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:54,048
Sleeping sweetly...

514
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:01,639
I won't tell
if you don't tell.

515
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:08,688
Listen to me!

516
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:10,356
This whole building is unsafe.

517
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,025
They cut corners everywhere.

518
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,527
People! It's a deathtrap.

519
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:15,361
No, Dad,

520
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:17,197
you fell asleep
in front of the TV,

521
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,365
watching
<i>The Towering Inferno.</i>

522
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:22,869
How do you know the title
of my prophetic vision?

523
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:48,978
Shh!

524
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:51,898
