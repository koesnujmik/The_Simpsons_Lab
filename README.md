## Overview

**The Simpsons Lab** is not just an automated video editing tool —  
it is an experimental research project that attempts to **quantify and structure human laughter** through AI.

Using *The Simpsons*, a globally acclaimed comedy animation series, as our dataset,  
we have developed an AI-driven pipeline that can:

- Detect humorous scenes  
- Plan edits based on narration, subtitle timing, and contextual cues  
- Automatically generate full short-form videos, including subtitles and narration

This project is not merely about summarizing funny content.  
It explores a deeper question:

> **Can AI edit content in a way that actually makes people laugh?**

We believe this is the world’s **first research project on AI-powered humor editing** —  
a bold attempt at the intersection of media automation, affective computing, and narrative intelligence.





## Pipeline

The Simpsons Lab operates through a 3-stage pipeline powered by LLM-based scene understanding and automated video editing.

---

### Step 1 – Scene Analysis & Highlight Selection

**Goal**  
Automatically identify the funniest clips across an entire Simpsons episode and generate metadata describing each clip.

**Process**

- **Full Video Segmentation**:  
  The Gemini Agent (LLM1) analyzes the full episode by splitting it into 2-minute segments.

- **Humor Scoring**:  
  Each segment is evaluated using a prompt that includes predefined humor cues (e.g., screams, ad-libs, explosions), scoring each on a 1–10 scale.

- **Top 5 Clip Selection & Summarization**:  
  The five clips with the highest humor scores are selected. Each is automatically described in natural language.

**Output**  
A JSON file containing:

[
  {
    "start_time": 162,
    "end_time": 174,
    "score": 9.2,
    "description": "Homer sets off a fire alarm while panicking over a donut."
  },
]

**Step 1 — Scene Analysis**  
: Gemini 2.5 (LLM1) analyzes the full Simpsons episode and selects the top-5 funniest clips based on laughter-related cues.

**Step 2 — Shorts Edit Planning**  
: Gemini 2.5 (LLM2) combines highlight data and subtitle files to generate a Shorts Edit Plan JSON including timing, captions, and narration.

**Step 3 — Video Generation**  
: MoviePy renders the final MP4 video with all edits applied, ready for upload to YouTube Shorts.
