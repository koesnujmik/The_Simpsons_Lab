## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**The Simpsons Lab** is not just an automated video editing tool â€”  
it is an experimental research project that attempts to **quantify and structure human laughter** through AI.

Using *The Simpsons*, a globally acclaimed comedy animation series, as our dataset,  
we have developed an AI-driven pipeline that can:

- Detect humorous scenes  
- Plan edits based on narration, subtitle timing, and contextual cues  
- Automatically generate full short-form videos, including subtitles and narration

This project is not merely about summarizing funny content.  
It explores a deeper question:

> **Can AI edit content in a way that actually makes people laugh?**

We believe this is the worldâ€™s **first research project on AI-powered humor editing** â€”  
a bold attempt at the intersection of media automation, affective computing, and narrative intelligence.

**Welcome to The Simpsons Lab.**
